1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    Middleware in Express orchestrates the request-response cycle by executing functions in sequence,
    each accessing and potentially modifying the request (req) and response (res). 
    It's crucial for tasks like logging, authentication, and parsing. 
    If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, 
    it must call next() to pass control to the next function, ensuring the cycle continues smoothly, 
    otherwise, the request will be left hanging. 

2. What does CRUD stand for?
    CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
    These are the four basic operations of persistent storage in software development.
    Create: Adding new records or data entries.
    Read: Retrieving or reading existing data.
    Update: Modifying or updating existing data entries.
    Delete: Removing existing data entries.


3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    a. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
    To access the information stored in the .env file in a Node.js application, 
    I need the dotenv package (install it using npm install dotenv), and then I can 
    load the variables from the .env file into my app using require('dotenv').config( );

    b. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your 
    Github repository?
    To prevent my .env file from being stored in my GitHub repository, 
    I need to add  .env to .gitignore file in the root of my project, 
    so it won't be included in my repository.
