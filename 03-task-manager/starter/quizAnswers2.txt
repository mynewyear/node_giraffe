1. In this lesson, you created a middleware function called asyncWrapper. Why?

    The asyncWrapper middleware was created to enhance code maintainability
    and readability by centralizing error handling and reducing code repetition (DRY). 
    Try-catch logic as a single function, which makes the code cleaner and easier 
    to manage of different types of errors.

2. Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and an error message are sent back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist. Assume that you’ve created a CustomAPIError class and an error handler that references that class. Complete the code:
    const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
        const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
        const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
        if (!task) {  
            return next(createCustomError(`No task with id: ${taskID}`, 404)); 
        }  
        res.status(200).json({ task });  
    });
